# Gottman Institute Principles - ABF Integration

## Overview
The Gottman Method is a research-based approach to relationship therapy developed by Drs. John and Julie Gottman. ABF incorporates key principles to help couples strengthen their connection through structured communication.

## The Sound Relationship House Theory

Gottman's framework has 7 levels, from foundation to roof:

### 1. Build Love Maps
**What it is:** Knowing your partner's inner psychological world - their dreams, fears, hopes, values.

**ABF Integration:**
- Weekly check-in questions that reveal inner thoughts
- Rotating themes ensure breadth of topics
- Historical view shows how partner evolves
- "Deep Week" focused on meaningful questions

**Example Questions:**
- "What's something you're worried about but haven't shared?"
- "What would your perfect day look like?"
- "What's a childhood memory that shaped you?"

---

### 2. Share Fondness and Admiration
**What it is:** Expressing respect, affection, and appreciation for your partner.

**ABF Integration:**
- "Gratitude Week" dedicated to appreciation
- Every check-in includes space for positive acknowledgment
- Celebrate when both partners complete check-in
- Photo/music sharing to express affection

**Example Questions:**
- "What's something your partner did that made you feel loved?"
- "What quality do you most admire in your partner?"
- "When did your partner make you laugh recently?"

---

### 3. Turn Towards Instead of Away
**What it is:** Responding positively to partner's bids for attention, affection, or connection.

**ABF Integration:**
- Notifications as gentle "bids" for connection
- Completing check-in shows "turning towards"
- Comments on responses create dialogue
- Consistent weekly rhythm builds habit

**How it works:**
- Partner submits check-in → notification sent
- Responding promptly = turning towards
- Acknowledging their answers = engagement
- Starting conversations based on responses

---

### 4. The Positive Perspective
**What it is:** Viewing partner and relationship through positive lens, assuming good intentions.

**ABF Integration:**
- Focus on strengths, not problems
- Questions frame positively (not "what's wrong?")
- Celebrate small wins and consistency
- No judgment or criticism in prompts

**Design Choices:**
- Warm, encouraging tone throughout
- "Support Week" focuses on how to help, not what's lacking
- Progress visualization (not failure highlighting)
- Gentle reminders, never guilt trips

---

### 5. Manage Conflict (Perpetual Problems)
**What it is:** 69% of relationship problems are perpetual - learn to dialogue about them.

**ABF Integration (Future):**
- Not in MVP, but consider for Phase 3
- Could have "conflict check-in" questions
- Help identify perpetual vs. solvable problems
- Guide productive conversations

**Potential Questions:**
- "What's something we disagree on that we can accept?"
- "How can we compromise on [recurring issue]?"
- "What's underneath this conflict for you?"

---

### 6. Make Life Dreams Come True
**What it is:** Create an atmosphere that encourages each person to pursue their dreams.

**ABF Integration:**
- "Dreams Week" dedicated to aspirations
- Track goals and support progress
- Celebrate partner's achievements
- Plan how to support each other's dreams

**Example Questions:**
- "What's a goal you have for this year?"
- "How can I help you pursue your dream?"
- "What's holding you back from [X]?"

---

### 7. Create Shared Meaning
**What it is:** Build shared rituals, roles, goals, and symbols that make your relationship unique.

**ABF Integration:**
- Weekly check-in becomes a shared ritual
- Photo/music library creates shared memories
- Track milestones and anniversaries
- Build relationship narrative over time

**How it emerges:**
- Consistent weekly rhythm (ritual)
- Themes rotate but structure stays (predictability)
- Shared history visible in past check-ins
- Inside jokes and references develop

---

## Additional Gottman Concepts

### The Four Horsemen (What to Avoid)
ABF actively prevents these destructive patterns:

**1. Criticism** (attacking partner's character)
- ✅ ABF Solution: Questions focus on self-reflection, not partner critique
- ✅ No space to list complaints

**2. Contempt** (treating with disrespect/mockery)
- ✅ ABF Solution: Positive framing in all prompts
- ✅ Appreciation built into structure

**3. Defensiveness** (victim mentality)
- ✅ ABF Solution: Questions about self, not partner's faults
- ✅ Asynchronous responses (time to reflect)

**4. Stonewalling** (withdrawing from interaction)
- ✅ ABF Solution: Gentle reminders to engage
- ✅ Low-pressure format (5 minutes, text-based)
- ✅ Can complete when ready (not live conflict)

---

### Repair Attempts
**What it is:** Efforts to de-escalate tension during conflict.

**ABF Integration (Subtle):**
- Positive tone creates emotional safety
- Questions often naturally lead to repair
- "Support Week" asks how to help
- Private responses allow vulnerability

---

### The Magic Ratio (5:1)
**What it is:** Need 5 positive interactions for every 1 negative to maintain healthy relationship.

**ABF Design:**
- Every check-in is positive interaction
- No space for complaints (by design)
- Focus on appreciation, dreams, memories
- If 52 check-ins/year, that's 52+ positive interactions

## Ethical Considerations

### When to Recommend Professional Help:
If check-ins reveal:

Based on Gottman metrics:

### Indicators to Track:

## Key Takeaway

ABF succeeds by making Gottman principles **accessible and actionable**:
- Turn research into daily practice
- Lower barrier to consistent connection
- Make relationship maintenance habitual
- Celebrate the work couples already do
- Gentle nudges, not rigid requirements

The app should feel like a supportive friend, not a therapist or teacher. It's **scaffolding** for conversations couples want to have but don't always remember to initiate.
